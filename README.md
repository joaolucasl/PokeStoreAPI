# Pagar.me Challenge - Pokemon API
___

This project was built as part of the selection process for a position @ [Pagar.me](pagar.me), a Brazilian payments company offering awesome payment solutions for Brazil and LatAm.   
The challenge was to update an old and unmaintained API codebase and make it production-ready: refactoring, troubleshooting, organisation, etc.
